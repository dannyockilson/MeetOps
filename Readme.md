# MeetOps

Quick dev-ops style tools to help meetup organisers written in node.js

# NONE OF THIS EXISTS!! IT IS A LIE

I am documenting things up front so I know what I want and how the end
result of the tool should feel. Things may change but this is more of a
goal/scope document for the project.

## Folder Structure

```
- docs/ - documentation for project
- events/ - test event data for triggering functions
- functions/ - specific functions (to be hosted on AWS/GC/Azure Serverless)
- packages/ - npm packages published to npm for re-use
```
